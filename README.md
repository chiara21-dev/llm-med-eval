## LLM Medical Summary Evaluation

Developed a lightweight evaluation pipeline for LLM-generated medical summaries (N=50).
The pipeline computes rule-based coherence scores and fact-coverage metrics for healthcare prompts.

### Metrics
- Fact coverage of expected clinical concepts
- Rule-based coherence heuristics

### Artifacts
- llm_med_eval.ipynb
- prompts.csv
- metrics.csv
